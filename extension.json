  "longDescription": "# Replit-GPT\nA little ChatGPT in your Replit editor. If you open a file with GPT-replit, the file contents will be passed to the AI so you can ask questions about it.\n\n## Usage:\nPress the three dots at a file and click \"Open with GPT-Replit\". Now you can ask questions and the AI will know the content of the file so you can ask questions about it. You can also just open the Tool icon of GPT-Replit, to use it normal.\n## Settings.gptreplit\nThe `settings.gptreplit` file is an optional configuration file for the Replit-GPT API calls. To edit the settings you can create the `settings.gptreplit` file. Then a settings button will show up, there you can edit the temperature, import & export chats and change the model to something that isn't in the dropdown (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`). You'll have to paste the settings in the file yourself since I don't want to add the write file permission just for this feature.",
