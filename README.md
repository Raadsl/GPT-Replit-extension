"A little ChatGPT in your Replit editor. If you a file with it the file contents will be passed to the AI so you can ask questions about it."

It reponds with live updating text, there's a stop button to stop the AI from responding, and it is able to use GPT-4, GPT-4 32k & GPT-3.5 (if you have them". You can click on the 3 dots at a file if the extension is installed and click on "Open with GPT-Replit". Now you are able to ask the AI to fix an error in the file, add new stuff and more.
It uses the current Replit theme you use, and you can use your voice! Also double click to copy code!

## Additional Settings
The `settings.gptreplit` file is an optional configuration file for the Replit-GPT API calls. To edit the settings you can create the `settings.gptreplit` file. Then a settings button will show up, there you can edit the temperature, import & export chats and change the model to something that isn't in the dropdown (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`). You'll have to paste the settings in the file yourself since I don't want to add the write file permission just for this feature.
