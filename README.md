# GPT-Replit
"A little ChatGPT in your Replit editor. If you a file with it the file contents will be passed to the AI so you can ask questions about it."

It responses live update, there's a stop button to stop the AI from responding, and it is able to use GPT-4 & GPT-3.5. You can click on the 3 dots at a file if the extension is installed and click on "Open with GPT-Replit". Now you are able to ask the AI to fix an error in the file, add new stuff and more.
It uses the current Replit theme you use, and you can use your voice!
